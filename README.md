### What you will find here mostly üìä

> You will find here in this space **projects, testings & homeworks** that I have done during these years to advance my career in **Data Analysis / Data Science**.

> Most of the posted works here are notebooks with exercises and you can copy a few of them to also work in a similar project or even to develop yourself.

Please have a sit and take a look the things I have done recently - any feedbacks are extremely appreciated so I can improve the quality of my code / storytelling or even to get in touch.
